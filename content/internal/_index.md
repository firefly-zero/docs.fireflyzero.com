This section covers how Firefly Zero device works inside: file formats, file structure, some algorithms, etc. You don't need to know any of it if you want to use the device or make games.

If you're looking for information on using the device, go to [user docs](../user/). If you want to write your own games, go to [dev docs](../dev/).
