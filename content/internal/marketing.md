The key point in everything we do is we're not a big evil corporation. We are geeks that are tired of ads, AI, and investor-driven businesses. This might make it harder to reach wider audience but the people that do find us will have a stronger bond with our vision.

* **Writing style**
  * Keep it simple and honest. Keep it short and to the point.
  * Avoid bullshit words and business speak, like "empowering e-commerce businesses to disrupt the industry of AI". Here is some good writing:
    * [Big Walk trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXsLvmukUTc)
    * [Playdate website](https://play.date/)
  * Use only hashtags relevant to the post content, especially on small platforms.
* **Advertisement channels**
  * **Bad:** buying annoying ads.
  * **Good:** posting useful content to our socials that people will want to re-post.
  * **Bad:** paying people for feedback.
  * **Good:** providing free (or not) early previews to the geekiest geeks, encouraging them to post their honest reviews.
  * **Bad:** spamming every community.
  * **Good:** authentically being part of many communities and talking about Firefly.
* **Graphical style:**
  * Use [SWEETIE-16](https://lospec.com/palette-list/sweetie-16) color palette.
  * Use pixelated images and fonts (for titles), in the spirit of the graphics on the device.
  * Avoid overly-pixelated fonts for the main text, it might make it hard to read.
  * Use the official art: [firefly-art](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-art).
  * If the platform allows it, provide alt-text.
* **Availability:** no important information should be confined to platforms that cannot be viewed without registration, like Xitter, Instagram, or Discord. Open for read (and search indexing) resources: Mastodon, Pixelfed, docs.fireflyzero.com, blog.fireflyzero.com, Github.
* **Ethics:** avoid unethical trends (including past trends), like AI, blockchain, or NFTs.
