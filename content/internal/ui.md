This is the design guide for designing user interfaces for the system apps.

* We follow [Neobrutalism](https://www.neobrutalism.dev/) design adjusted for low-res pixelated screens.
* Font: `eg_6x9`.
* Respect user language
* Respect user color scheme
* Colors:
  * Primary: text, box borders
  * Secondary: disabled elements, inactive elements
  * Accent: active elements, headers
  * BG: background.
* Margins: 1, 2, 4N (N>0) px.
* Rounded corners: 4px.
* Box border width: 1px.
* Use lowercase text except where the grammar requires it (abbreviations, names, country names in English, etc) and paragraphs of text.
* Cursor has 1px shadow on bottom-right.
* Pairs of yes/no buttons are aligned on the same line, with no/back/previous/cancel on the left and yes/forward/next/accept on the right.
