## Installation

[Download emulator binary](https://github.com/firefly-zero/firefly-emulator-bin/releases) and put it into `$PATH`. Now you can run it by running `firefly_emulator` in the terminal.

## Input

The emulator supports the following input methods, from best to worst.

1. (⌛ Coming soon) Firefly Zero device
1. Steam controller
1. Gamepad
1. (⌛ Coming soon) UI buttons
1. Keyboard

### Firefly Zero device

(⌛ Coming soon)

### Steam controller

It is discontinued but you may find a used one. It has a touchpad just like Firefly Zero, and that makes it a better fit, compared to Xbox controllers, for apps requiring a precise input.

The controls are the same as for any other gamepad. See the next section.

### Gamepad

* The buttons (`A`, `B`, `X`, and `Y`) are the same and work the same as on the actual device.
* The `start` button on the controller does the same as `menu` on the device.
* The touch pad is emulated by the left stick. The input from the stick is read only if you press the LB (left shoulder button). This is because unlike touch pad, the stick is always active, even in the resting state.

### UI buttons

(⌛ Coming soon)

### Keyboard

Keyboard is quite far from how inputs work on the device. It doesn't have a touchpad. The controls are the following:

1. `Esc`: close the emulator
1. `Z` or `Enter`: A
1. `X`: B
1. `A`: X
1. `S`: Y
1. `Tab` or `Backspace`: menu
1. `←` or `4`: touchpad left
1. `→` or `6`: touchpad right
1. `↑` or `8`: touchpad up
1. `↓` or `2`: touchpad down
1. `5`: touchpad middle
