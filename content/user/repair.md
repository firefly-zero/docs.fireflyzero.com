This page is a draft. It will be properly filled in when we have the final version of the device.
{{< /hint >}}

Firefly Zero is a sustainable device and we believe in your [right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair). We want everyone to truly own the things they buy and understand how these things work.

Opening and disassembling Firefly Zero **does not** void the warranty. However, breaking the device while disassembling (just like other intentional damage) **voids the warranty**. So, before you get started, make sure you know what you're doing. And this page is here to guide you.

## What's inside?

First of all, let's get to know what's inside Firefly Zero.

(In future, this list will include links to specific components and their model numbers)

1. LCD screen
1. Cirque touchpad
1. 5 buttons
1. LEDs
1. Battery
1. Custom-made PCB with 2 ESP32-S3 chips.

## Before opening

1. Assess the damage. If you already know what's broken (for example, you see a big scratch on the screen), order the components using the links above. If not, make sure you have a safe place to store the disassembled device after you opened it to assess the damage and before the new components arrive.
1. Prepare the tools that you'll need:
    1. Screwdriver
    1. A piece of plastic to open the case (guitar pick, unused plastic card, etc)
    1. A small brush to brush off dirt and dust
    1. Latext gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on electronic components
    1. A soft piece of cloth so that when you put the device with the screen down you don't scratch the screen.
    1. A small box to store the screws in.
    1. If you replace touchpad, get good glue.
1. Make sure you have good lighting.
1. Get your phone and make sure to take photos of every step.
1. Get your cat out of the room.

## How to open

1. Take the SD card out.
1. Put the device screen down on a soft cloth.
1. Unscrew the screws and put them in a box.
1. Tell your cat to stop meowing.
1. Open the case by inserting a piece of sliding between the two panels of the case and sliding it along the crack.
1. Keep taking photos!
1. Unscrew the screws on PCB.
1. Slowly raise PCB up. Watch out for the screen connector.
1. Disconnect the screen.
1. If you need to replace the touchpad, it's glued! Push it out.

When you replace the broken component, do all the same in the reverse order. If in doubts, check the photos you've been taking.

When you finish, feed the cat.
