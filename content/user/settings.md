You can change device settings in the "System Settings" app.

**Navigation:**

* Press up or down on the touchpad to move the cursor between available options.
* Press left or right when the cursor is on the header to switch between tabs.
* Press `E` (`Enter` on emulator) to activate or change the selected option.

## 💬 Language

Select the preferred interface language. This affects all system apps and some games. Translations are a community effort. If your languages is not on the list or some translations are incorrect, you can help us by translating the relevant app.

## 📅 Date and time

Set date, time, and timezone. Currently all options are disabled and cannot be adjusted.

## 👀 Interface

* **color scheme**: the preferred colors of the interface. Just scroll through the options (with `E` or left/right) and pick what you like. The "light" themes have the white background and "dark" themes have the black one. If you want the system to use the most contrast colors, the "light contrast" and "dark contrast" are the most contrast themes.
* **high contrast**: increase the contrast of some colors. It adjusts the default color palette (used by all system apps and the majority of games) to use true white for white and true black for black. Some games might apply additional changes for better accesibility.
* **screen brightness**: change the brightness of the screen bakclight.
* **reduce flashing**: avoid rapid flashes that might trigger seizures. Firefly Zero will try to make transitions between screens, games, and menus smooth. Transitions and effects within games might be (or might be not) adjusted. Consult the game page in the catalog for accessibility info.
* **rotate screen**: turn the image on the screen upside-down. Allows to hold the device upside-down, effectively having touchpad on the right and buttons on the left. We recommend enabling this setting only if you have accessibility limitations. The standard device layout has a better ergonomic and should be more comfortable to hold.
* **auto lock**: Automatically lock the screen after 5 minutes of inactivity (no input). Disabled in multiplayer.

## 🍲 Misc

* **gamepad mode**: if enabled, Firefly Zero, when connected to computer via USB, will be recognized as a gamepad. It is especially useful for game development, to play games in emulator with the real device controls.
* **easter eggs**: enable easter eggs, secrets, holiday effects, and unimportant jokes.
* **telemetry**: allow the device to collect and send to Firefly Zero engineers anonymous statistics and crash reports. What specifically is collected might change over time (at the moment, we don't collect anything) but it will always be opt-in, transparent, and privacy-respecting. Remember, Firefly Zero is 100% open-source, so the community knows exactly how it works.
* **reset all settings**: return all settings, including language, to their defaults.
